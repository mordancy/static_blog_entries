#it is a good idea to run apt-get update and upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

#vnc server, xrdp, or another server program, I installed xrdp
sudo apt-get install xrdp

#ssh into the pi

#connect from linux to the pi using a remote desktop program like rdesktop
# flag u for pi username (optional - will prompt if not provided)
# flag p for pi password (optional - will prompt if not provided)
# then provide the ip address or server name
rdesktop -u pi -p raspberry 10.42.0.54 # ip address from above
rdesktop 10.42.0.54
rdesktop raspberrypi.local





#issues

#then is created and recreate it after conncting the pi and change the ip4 setting
